# Ask tool contract

`ask_user` is a pi-native clarification tool for cases where implementation depends on user preference or missing requirements.

This document defines the stable external behavior. It does not explain internal helper-by-helper implementation.

## Input

```ts
{
  title?: string;
  questions: Array<{
    id: string;
    label?: string;
    prompt: string;
    type?: "single" | "multi" | "preview";
    required?: boolean;
    options: Array<{
      value: string;
      label: string;
      description?: string;
      preview?: string;
      recommended?: boolean;
    }>;
  }>;
}
```

## Input rules

- at least one question is required
- every question must have non-empty trimmed `id` and `prompt`
- every question must have at least one option
- question ids must be unique within one tool call
- option `value`s must be unique within a question
- blank optional `title`, question `label`, option `description`, and option `preview` fields are treated as omitted
- question `label` falls back to `Q1`, `Q2`, ...
- option `label` is required in the public schema; before schema validation, a missing or blank string label is derived from a non-empty `value` by replacing hyphens and underscores with spaces and capitalizing the first character
- `recommended` is optional presentation metadata; zero, one, or multiple options may set it to `true`
- recommended options render warning-colored `(recommended)` followed by muted ` | <description>`, or only `(recommended)` when no description exists, but are not preselected
- `type` defaults to `single`
- `required` defaults to `false`
- `required` is metadata only; it never blocks submission
- preview questions require preview text for every declared option; option descriptions do not satisfy this requirement, and invalid preview payloads report a fix hint to add preview text or switch to `type: "single"`
- all questions get an internal `Type your own` option

## Output rules

- `cancelled: true` means the user dismissed the flow, UI was unavailable, or the payload was invalid before UI opened
- semantically invalid payloads that reach tool execution return `error.kind === "invalid_input"` with structured `issues` and a transcript-friendly `Invalid ask_user payload:` message; their rendered status is `Invalid tool payload`
- payloads missing schema-required fields fail Pi's schema validation before tool execution and use Pi's standard tool-error result without structured `details`
- `mode: "submit"` is normal completion; `mode: "elaborate"` means the user asked the agent to continue with follow-up clarification based on notes
- unanswered questions without notes are omitted from `answers`; note-only entries remain in `answers` to carry their notes, but all non-cancelled submitted result text includes `<label>: (no answer)` in summary mode and `? <label>: (no answer)` in transcript rendering
- in `mode: "elaborate"`, `answers` contains only committed answers; note-only entries move to `elaboration.items`
- `continuation.strategy === "refine_only"` means the next ask should refine the current flow rather than restart it
- `continuation.preservedAnswers` contains previously committed answers that should be kept as context and not re-asked
- `continuation.affectedQuestionIds` lists the only questions that should be revisited
- `continuation.questionStates` marks each question as `answered`, `needs_clarification`, or `unanswered`
- non-cancelled results with flagged questions include `laymanExplanation` in either submit or elaborate mode, with full question/option context, user notes, and plain-language/example instructions
- flagged questions are omitted from `answers` and from committed elaboration answers; their privately saved choices/custom text are never sent as answers
- results with flags include `continuation` even in submit mode: flagged questions are `needs_clarification`, other committed answers are preserved, and unresponded questions remain `unanswered`
- model-visible result text includes other answers, the requested questions/options/notes, and instructions to explain in everyday language first, then re-ask only flagged questions if needed; cancellation sends no explanation request
- single-select answers still use arrays
- recommendation markers never change canonical submitted labels or values
- when `behaviour.presentSingleAsMulti` is enabled, requested single-select questions are presented and handled as multi-select in future/replayed ask flows; result question metadata keeps the requested `type`, adds `presentedType` when final presentation differs, and result text uses one compact note when any answered questions were presented differently
- `indices` are 1-based rendered option positions
- `customText` stores the free-form answer
- on single-select questions, saving free-form text clears selected options for that question
- on multi-select questions, `values` and `labels` include both selected options and `customText` when both are present
- on multi-select questions, selected options keep their original order and `customText` is appended last
- submitting free-form text on a multi-select question stays on the same question tab and marks the custom row selected
- on multi-select questions, toggling an empty custom row opens the free-form editor, while toggling a custom row with saved free-form text selects or deselects it without opening the editor or clearing the text
- saving or clearing free-form text on a multi-select question does not clear other selected options
- `note` stores a question-level note
- `optionNotes` includes only notes for selected options
- question notes may exist without a selected answer
- `elaboration.items` includes all question notes and all option notes, even for unselected options
- every elaboration item includes the full normalized question and option list for that question so referential notes like `above` remain understandable to the agent
- option-targeted elaboration items include the specific noted option plus whether it is currently selected
- question-targeted elaboration items include whether the question already has a committed answer
- `elaboration.instruction` tells the agent to answer the clarification directly first, then re-ask only the affected questions if a choice is still needed
- after clarification, agents should prefer another structured follow-up over plain-text multiple choice when a decision is still unresolved
- once prior answers narrow the branch, agents should bundle the next 2-3 related unresolved questions into one follow-up ask when possible, instead of using a long sequence of single-question asks
- `elaboration` is only present when `mode === "elaborate"`
- elaborate `content` text and transcript rendering describe each note directly using the full question prompt and option label, and include the current committed answer text when available, instead of a generic elaboration banner
- when the user selects `Elaborate` without adding notes, elaborate `content` text and transcript rendering still include the committed answer text so the agent can elaborate on that answer directly

## Supported UX

- tabbed multi-question flow
- single-select, multi-select, and preview questions
- optional warning-colored recommendation subtitles in standard and preview option lists without automatic selection
- active question type changes via configurable `main.changeQuestionType` hotkey, default `t`; non-preview questions toggle `single <-> multi`; preview questions toggle `preview <-> multi`
- per-question layman explanation requests via configurable `main.requestLaymanExplanation` (default `l`), with dimmed/locked choices, a visible request message, and review/tab indicators
- pressing the shortcut again removes the request and restores the privately saved selection/custom answer; other questions and their answers are unaffected
- flags count as responses for configured auto-submit, but do not bypass the existing review-tab and no-notes requirements
- inline free-form answers for all question types
- native pi-style `@` file path autocomplete inside free-form answer and note editors
- question notes via `Shift+N`
- option notes via `n`
- number-key quick selection
- submit/elaborate/cancel review tab
- on the review tab, `Submit` and `Cancel` preview notes only for answered questions
- on the review tab, `Elaborate` preview expands to all question notes and all option notes, including notes on unselected options
- transcript-friendly call and result rendering
- `/answer` command to convert the latest completed assistant message into an `AskParams` form through a synthetic `ask_user` tool call and open the ask UI
- `/answer` extraction may use an internal `freeform: true` option for open-ended questions with no explicit choices; these render as user-input-only questions with the label `Type your answer:`, no numbered option row, and no selection caret; this marker is not part of the public `ask_user` tool contract
- `/answer:again` command to replay the latest `/answer`-extracted form on the current branch
- `/ask:replay` command to replay the latest real `ask_user` form on the current branch
- automatic recovery of the newest unresolved `ask_user` form on startup, resume, or fork
- ask settings list with binary behaviour/notification toggles and a guarded reset-to-defaults action
- `?` in the ask flow and `/ask-settings` in pi open the same lightweight ask settings overlay
- settings attempt to persist immediately when changed: `Auto-submit when answered without notes`, `Confirm dismiss when dirty`, `Double-press review shortcuts`, `Notifications`, and `Show footer hints`; `Present single-select as multi-select` persists immediately when saving succeeds but applies only to new/replayed ask flows; save failures revert the setting and show a manual-edit message; resetting config to defaults requires pressing the reset action twice within a short confirmation window
- the additive schema-version-5 `main.requestLaymanExplanation` keymap defaults in memory to `l` when absent, or to an unbound action if an existing main/global binding already owns `l`; existing bindings are preserved and `[]` can explicitly disable this new shortcut
- `Keymaps` is a persisted, context-aware config section for global, main-flow, editor, note-editor, and settings-modal actions
- the settings list shows the absolute config file path for customizing keymaps, notifications, and extraction settings
- if the flow is already on the review tab, all questions are answered, and no notes exist, enabling auto-submit can complete the current ask flow immediately
- elaborate results are phrased as direct follow-up instructions, for example: `User asked to elaborate on question "Which option would you like to select?" option "Option A" with note "why this one?"`

## Keyboard behavior

Main flow:

- `global.settings` opens ask settings; default: `?`
- `global.dismiss` dismisses the active ask surface; default: `Ctrl+C`
- `main.nextTab` / `main.previousTab` move between tabs; defaults: `Tab`/`Right`, `Shift+Tab`/`Left`
- `main.nextOption` / `main.previousOption` move between options or review actions; defaults: `Down`, `Up`
- `main.confirm`, `main.cancel`, and `main.toggle` confirm, cancel, or toggle; defaults: `Enter`, `Esc`, `Space`
- `main.changeQuestionType` changes the active question type (non-preview: `single <-> multi`; preview: `preview <-> multi`); default: `t`; destructive `multi -> single` changes require pressing the type hotkey again, with no timeout, and the pending confirmation clears on other navigation/actions
- `main.requestLaymanExplanation` toggles an explanation request for the active question; default: `l`; saved choices remain private while flagged, and selecting/toggling options, opening custom input, moving between options, and changing question type are disabled; `Enter` continues to the next tab and normal tab navigation/notes/settings remain available; the action has no effect on Review
- `main.optionNote` and `main.questionNote` open option/question notes; defaults: `n`, `Shift+N`
- `1..9` is fixed and selects or toggles the matching option; on the review tab, `1`, `2`, and `3` trigger `Submit`, `Elaborate`, and `Cancel`
- when `Double-press review shortcuts` is enabled, review-tab `1`, `2`, and `3` require the same key twice without a timeout, and the review screen shows an inline hint for the pending action

Editing flow:

- `editor.submit` submits the current custom-answer editor input and closes the editor; default: `Enter`
- `noteEditor.save` saves the current note editor and keeps the ask flow open; default: `Enter`
- `editor.close` / `noteEditor.close` save draft and close the editor; default: `Esc`
- `global.dismiss` dismisses the entire flow immediately without saving the current editor draft when no dirty-dismiss confirmation is pending
- `global.settings` opens ask settings when the editor is empty; otherwise the key is delegated to the editor as text/input
- when editor has text, arrow keys and `Tab` stay in the editor so the cursor can move while typing
- when editor is empty, editor-context `*WhenEmpty` navigation actions move options or tabs without requiring the editor close binding first
- `@` remains a fixed file-reference affordance in editors

Settings modal:

- `settingsModal.close` closes settings; defaults: `Esc`, `Ctrl+C`, `?`
- `settingsModal.nextOption` / `settingsModal.previousOption` move between settings; defaults: `Down`, `Up`
- `settingsModal.toggle` toggles the highlighted setting and attempts to save immediately; if saving fails, the setting reverts and an error is shown; on the reset action, the same binding must be pressed twice within a short confirmation window; defaults: `Enter`, `Space`

Dirty dismiss:

- when `Confirm dismiss when dirty` is enabled, cancelling or dismissing a dirty ask flow requires the same action a second time
- the dirty-dismiss warning stays visible until the user changes tabs in the ask flow

## Non-TUI and non-interactive modes

The rich ask flow uses `ctx.ui.custom()` and opens only in TUI mode. In print, JSON, RPC, or any other non-TUI mode, the tool returns a `Needs user input: ask_user requires interactive TUI mode.` message in `content` and a cancelled result in `details` instead of opening custom UI.

The public tool schema requires question `id` and `prompt` plus option `value` and `label`, and it restricts question `type` to `single`, `multi`, or `preview`, so malformed structural fields fail before execution. The tool still validates trimmed text, uniqueness, option counts, and preview requirements during execution and returns structured issues for those failures. Result rendering falls back to Pi's raw tool-error text when schema validation prevents execution.

The ask flow subscribes to runtime settings updates while open. In practice, this means changing `Auto-submit when answered without notes`, `Confirm dismiss when dirty`, `Double-press review shortcuts`, `Notifications`, `Show footer hints`, resetting config to defaults, or reloading config-backed keymaps can affect the in-progress ask flow immediately instead of only future asks when the change is saved or otherwise applied in memory. Load-time migrations and invalid config handling do not rewrite, rename, or back up the config file; invalid files load defaults for the session and show a notice. `Present single-select as multi-select` is applied when an ask flow is created and does not rewrite question semantics for an already-open flow; use `main.changeQuestionType` for live per-question changes.

## Notifications

When enabled, pi-ask emits one best-effort external notification per ask session after the ask UI opens and waits for input. The default title is `pi ask`; the message is `Question waiting: <label or prompt>`. Channels run in configured order and failures never fail or cancel the ask flow.

## Remote inter-extension events

pi-ask exposes a local `pi.events` contract for trusted Pi extensions. It does not expose a network API and does not automate terminal keystrokes. RPC or headless integrations should use a trusted in-process bridge extension that consumes these events rather than expecting the TUI-only custom surface to open.

Channels:

- `@eko24ive/pi-ask:started`
- `@eko24ive/pi-ask:completed`
- `@eko24ive/pi-ask:submit`
- `@eko24ive/pi-ask:submit-result`

Remote submissions must be explicit `{ kind: "answer" }` or `{ kind: "cancel" }` responses. Remote answers use question ids and normalized option values from the started event. pi-ask validates ids and values, recomputes labels/indices, and does not infer approval semantics from labels.

See [`remote-events.md`](remote-events.md) for payload shapes, examples, and a local smoke test.

## Slash command replay/extraction

- valid `ask_user` payloads are persisted as branch custom entries before the UI opens, so `/ask:replay` can reopen them after cancel, `/resume`, or `/tree`
- `/answer` scans the current branch for the latest assistant message; if that message did not finish with `stop`, extraction is refused
- `/answer` sends the preceding user message as context with the latest assistant text and asks the extractor for one synthetic `ask_user` tool call
- missing or invalid tool calls are retried according to `answer.extractionRetries`; raw or fenced JSON text remains supported as a last-resort fallback
- `{ "questions": [] }` from extraction means no questions were found and is not treated as an invalid ask payload
- command-flow cancellation closes with a notification and does not send a message to the agent
- submitted or elaborated command-flow results are sent back with user-message semantics
- replay commands scan only `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()`, ignore sibling/future branch payloads, and revalidate stored payloads before opening the UI

## Interrupted ask resume

- on `session_start` with reason `startup`, `resume`, or `fork`, pi-ask finds the newest `ask_user` tool call on the active branch that has neither a tool result nor an `ask:pending-dismissed` entry
- recovery does not run for `new`, `reload`, or non-TUI sessions
- the matching valid `ask:payload` supplies the form; if it is missing or invalid, pi-ask validates and uses the original tool call arguments instead
- the recovery flow is detached from `session_start`, so an open form does not block other lifecycle handlers
- because the interrupted `execute` promise no longer exists, submit sends the result with the same user-message semantics as replay commands
- submit and cancel both append `ask:pending-dismissed`, which prevents another automatic reopen; `/ask:replay` still works
- recovered flows emit remote lifecycle events with source `ask:resume`

The fallback message includes normalized pending questions and options so the caller can re-ask them manually. `details.questions` still contains normalized question metadata, while `details.answers` stays empty until a user responds.

## Skill alignment (advisory)

The auto-bundled skill profile at `skills/ask-user/SKILL.md` defines agent-side decision-gate guidance for when to call `ask_user`. It is enabled by default when the package is installed, but can be disabled via `pi config`.

It is advisory only. If there is any conflict, contract + tests win.

## Source of truth

Behavior should be verified against:

1. `src/types.ts` and exported state/result helpers
2. `tests/*.test.ts`
3. this contract
